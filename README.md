# Mini Challenge 6 - Odd or Even
# Project will take user's input and print into the terminal whether the number is even or odd. It will also have an error for when user input is not a number. Will also have play again function.

The program did what it was intended. The number i input was declared as odd or even. There was also data confirmation for both if it was a vaild entry when i first entered in a number. I like how after the second time i inputed a invaild option it returned me to the begining of the program. However there was a small issue with data confirmation at the end of Brandon's work. So when i enterered in something that wasnt 'yes' or 'no' the program would make me replay the game. I told Brandon about the issue and he said he would correct it, which is great that he is willing to change his errors.
